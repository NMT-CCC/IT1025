## Executive Summary 
This week we explore further into file compression and zip files. We examine object oriented programming with Python

## File Compression
### Purpose of File Compression
Compressed files can take up to 50-90% less space than its original file, so compressing a file will free up space on your hard drive. It will also improve transmission speed if you need to send the file, and you can password protect an entire zip folder to secure a set of documents.

### Compression and File Size
In saving my SVG file, it went from 45.9kb to 8.62kb. That is an 81.22% decrease in file size. This shows just how much space you could potentially save on your harddrive by zipping files  that you don't access often.

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class

### Attributes: 
Classes are the blueprint from which the objects are created. Each class in python can have many attributes.

### Methods: 
If classes are a blueprint from which objects are created, then methods define what that blueprint is, and how it will act.

### Constructor:  
The constructor is a method that is called when an object is created. This method is defined in the class and can be used to initialize basic variables.
If you create four objects, the class constructor is called four times.

### Class vs. Object: 
An object is an instantiation of a class. Think of a class like the blueprint of a car. Ford makes cars (objects) based on the rules and information enclosed in the blueprint.
 

## Object Oriented Concepts
### Instantiated Object is
An instantiated object is, so far as I can tell, the actual creation and running of an object. In our Shark code, the defining of the “shark” actions such as “be_awesome” and “swim” are the instantiated objects.
### Inheritance
An inheritance in OOP is one class that has been made from another class. This can be used to break out into smaller classes. For our “Shark” code you could then have types of sharks, and a variety of actions.
### Encapsulation and Abstraction
Encapsulation is packing of data and the methods or function under a single unit. I think the example within our shark code would be the lines within main(). 
Abstraction is hiding the implementation and complexity and showing declaration and essential features of the object. For our shark code, I think the example would be inside the definitions of say “be_awesome”, you won't see in the code, further down, that this will print out that this means print("The shark is being awesome.").

## Unified Modeling Language (UML)
The Unified Modeling Language is another software language that helps you visualize the design of a system. The goal of UML is to provide a standard notation that can be used by a broad range of applications. For instance, there is a class diagram, component diagram, object, package, profile, sequence, timing, etc.

## Conclusion
After this unit, I definitely need to look into more Python lessons. This unit was very confusing, and I feel like I should have had a full programming course before this, but I did my best. 
I feel like I have a good handle on compression, but OOP is definitely going to require more work on my part. UML looks like the lucid charting program that we used a few weeks back, and I am interested to look into that further.

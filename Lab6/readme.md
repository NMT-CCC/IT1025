## Executive Summary 
Describe various protocols that are widely used on the internet. Explore some internet programming methodologies and practice creating a web page with HTML and CSS.  

## Internet Architecture

### Internet Protocol
An IP address is a set of unique numbers assigned to every device that connects to the internet. IPv4 was developed in the 1980’s, and it was used for about 30 years. However, we began to run out of room, and there were only 3.7 billion addresses available in IPv4. Today, we use IPv6 which has 340 undecillion addresses. IPv6 has a 128-bit address space, compared to IPv4’s 32-bit address space.

#### IP Address
My internet connection:

   Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::98c9:21e5:e536:6391%20
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.182
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.1

#### ICANN
ICANN stands for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, they are an organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces and numerical spaces of the Internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation.

### TCP/IP

#### Responsibility of TCP/IP
TCP/IP stands for “Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol”. TCP/IP is a collection of protocols for data transfer between two devices. Even when it appears that hundreds of computers are actively sharing data between them, there are only two devices in every given data exchange.

#### Client-Server Model and TCP/IP
The client (computer)  initiates communication, The server receives that request for communication and allocates a port for the two machines to have a transfer of data over TCP/IP.

#### Layers
Layers are important to changing technology in that it allows one piece to be changed if needed, rather than having to change the whole thing as new technology emerges.

#### Application Layer
The Application layer interacts with the software or program. Applications will choose which transmission protocol to use based on their function. HTTP, POP3, IMAP4, SMTP, etc.

## Internet Security
### HTTP and Client-Server Model
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and is the most commonly used protocol in the world today. It is used for transferring web page information from the internet to the client. So requests would go from the client to the internet, to the website’s server, then bring the data back to the client via HTTP.

### Protocols for Secure HTTP
HTTPS ensures that the clients data is encrypted before going out into the internet. So that if there are any hackers listening to client data they would only see a stream of useless input instead of phone numbers, addresses, credit cards, etc.

## Securing your Web Browser
### Reasons to Secure Browser
Almost everyone does some sort of shopping or bill paying online, and that means you putting your personal information out on to the web. Hackers could exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive information, destroy your files, and use your computer to attack other computers.  So users need to be careful and secure their web browsers.

### Risk Explained
When a user opens up an internet browser, they open up a continual connection to the internet, and they interact with websites that could contain malware and other threats. You can do several things to mitigate this risk, such as making sure your browser is always up to date, having a good antimalware software installed on your computer and using a password management software to keep your passwords encrypted.

## Internet Programming
### World Wide Web Consortium
Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He and others created W3C 
(World Wide Web Consortium) achieves. Its goal is to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the Web.

Web COntent Accessibility Guidelines or WCAG is an internet standard for making websites more accessible for people with disabilities. This can include captions, audio descriptions, the ability to resize or recolor text, adjusting timeouts on pages, text to audio alternatives and much more. 

### HTML5 and CSS
HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, and the standard across the internet. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and can control the layout of multiple webpages at once, saving a lot of time.

### HTML and XML
XML doesn’t DO anything, it’s information within tags. HTML displays the data, with a focus on how it looks, XML is focused on the actual data.
 
## Components of a URL
Match the following terms / definitions under the heading and explain how they are related by providing an example of all of the pieces of a URL: 
 
Scheme - https
Domain - www.amazon.com
Default page - No file path provided
Parameters - result of search
Anchor - specific location on a page.
Top level domain - .edu

## Conclusion
We learned a lot of interesting facts in this unit. About Internet Protocols and Internet Security. 
We learned about the risks involved with going on the internet and how to mitigate some of that risk. We explored HTML and CSS, and the components of a URL.

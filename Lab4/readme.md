## Executive Summary 
In unit 4, we practice using the  command line in our operating system.    
Explore additional software including: an interactive programming environment, graphics and creating vectors.  


## Python IDLE
IDLE is a Python Editor. If you use the interactive shell component, it runs instructions one at a time and shows you the result immediately. The file editor lets you input Python code for complete programs to be run all at once. 

## Code Examples

### Variable:
A variable is essentially a container for storing data values.
int (4+5)
9

### Assignment statement:
An assignment statement assigns objects to a number or name.
x = 34
f = 6
int (x+f)
40

### Function:
A function is a group of code that can be called from anywhere after the function is defined.
(This code is originally from https://www.online-python.com/online_python_compiler)

def sum(a, b):
    return (a + b)

a = int(input('Enter 1st number: '))
b = int(input('Enter 2nd number: '))

print(f'The sum of {a} and {b} is {sum(a, b)}')

### Three data types:
Integers - An integer is a whole number that you can manipulate in Python. 
Float-  A Float is a number with a decimal point, such as 3.14.
String - A String is a line of text inside quotes in a line of code.

## Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
Raster images can be zoomed in on to get more detail, like a google map view. If you try to resize the image larger than its original size, however, you will lose quality.
Vector images are made with mathematical formulas and you won't lose image quality when you make the image larger or smaller. This can be especially useful if you are using the same image in several places at different sizes, such as a company logo.

### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
Lossy compression can delete data that will not be noticeable. 
Lossless compression will not delete any data from the original file.

### File Formats
.jpg, .gif, and .png are all image file formats. 
JPG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group - .jpg files are the most common for photographs and high resolution pictures and can be compressed to fit a large photo into a relatively small file.
GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format - .gif files are very common on the internet, and are normally used for small animations, or 8 bit images.
PNG stands for Portable Network Graphics - .png files are great for transparent pictures and use lossless compression.

### File Properties
When you right click on a file, a .jpg in my example, it gives your quite a bit of information. File type is JPG, and opens with Microsoft Photo, what program the file opens the file can be changed here as well. Size is 547 kb (560,552 bytes). Its location path on your harddrive. Date of creation, when it was last accessed or modified. You can also set security parameters on this file, including which users can access or change this file.

## Conclusion
We have now learned how to use the command line in our operating system.  We learned how to utilize the Python IDLE Editor, and various components of Python code, including the 3 types of data that Python uses. We then looked at Graphics file types and compressions, and lastly, file properties.

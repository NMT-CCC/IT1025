## Executive Summary

In unit 4, we practice using the  command line in our operating system.    
We explore elements of Python programming and data types, as well as learning how to use a compiler. We also examine different image compression types.


## Python IDLE

IDLE is a Python Editor. If you use the interactive shell component, it runs instructions one at a time and shows you the result immediately. The file editor lets you input Python code for complete programs to be run all at once. 

## Code Examples

### Variable:

int (4+5)

9

### Assignment statement:

x = 34

f = 6

int (x+f)

40

### Function:

(This code is originally from https://www.online-python.com/online_python_compiler)

def sum(a, b):

return (a + b)

a = int(input('Enter 1st number: '))

b = int(input('Enter 2nd number: '))

print(f'The sum of {a} and {b} is {sum(a, b)}')

### Three data types:

- Integers - An integer is a whole number that you can manipulate in Python. 
- Float-  A Float is a number with a decimal point, such as 3.14.
- String - A String is a line of text inside quotes in a line of code.

## Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
- Raster images can be zoomed in on to get more detail, like a google map view. If you try to resize the image larger than its original size, however, you will lose quality.
- Vector images are made with mathematical formulas and you won't lose image quality when you make the image larger or smaller. This can be especially useful if you are using the same image in several places at different sizes, such as a company logo.

### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
- Lossy compression can delete data that will not be noticeable. 
- Lossless compression will not delete any data from the original file.

### File Formats

### File Properties

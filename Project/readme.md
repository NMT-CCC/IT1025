### Executive Summary

Include your executive summary

### Part Part 1: Project Intent and Plan

I will be trying to program a dice roller in python. Ideally I will create a prompt and response for each polyhedral die. "Roll 1d20" should give you a random number from 1-20.

### Project Part 2:

If you elected option 1 describe the process you followed to become co-op ready and the name of your career coach OR, for option 2, present your program, application, reach etc.  There is no specific guidelines on the length or development success.  Some students plan on creating an app and find that they only got to determining the full purpose, outcomes and technology which is fine.  The purpose of the project is to take a topic of particular interest to you and spend some more time to gain a deeper level of understanding.

See Blackboard or OneNote (depending on your class) for details

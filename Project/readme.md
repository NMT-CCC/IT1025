### Executive Summary

This program will roll 4 six sided dice, and drop the lowest integer.

### Part Part 1: Project Intent and Plan
~~I will be trying to program a dice roller in python. Ideally I will create a prompt and response for each polyhedral die. "Roll 1d20" should give you a random number from 1-20.~~
I originally wanted to create a dice roller for each polyhedral dice in D&D, but after quite a bit of frustration, I changed my idea. Now the program rolls 4 six sided dice, and drops the lowest integer.

### Project Part 2:

### Conclusion

This was more difficult than I first thought. I struggled with the code for the original dice rolling program for about 2 weeks before scrapping that idea. I did quite a bit of research on various portions of this code, and more yelling at my computer than I care to admit. It finally does what I wanted it to do!

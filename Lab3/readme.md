## Executive Summary 
- Review different types of software 
- Discuss virtualization
- Practice working in Python   
- Explore future career paths, as well as organizations that may help us achieve our goals.

## Software
There are three main types of software.

- Operating Systems: Every computer has an operating system. Operating systems allow you to interface with the hardware, manage the hardware resources of the computer, and platform for software developers to write applications. Windows is probably the most common OS, followed by Apple iOS, and Linux.

- Utility Programs: Utility programs allow you to change or modify your computer in some way. Such as anti-malware software or a disk cleanup program. Malwarebytes, CCLeaner are examples of utility programs.

- Applications: Application software does a specific thing, like word processing, playing a video game, or accessing the internet. Google Chrome, Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat.


### ERP
ERP stands for Enterprise Resource Planning. ERP is an organizational software that is used by an entire organization or company. They can be created for specific purposes, such as manufacturing, planning, or fulfilling online orders. All the information is stored in a central database. 

## Virtualization
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
Virtualization is the foundation of cloud computing. You can have all of your email on an external server, you can access it from any computer and not have to take up any local harddrive space. 

### Role of Hypervisor
A hypervisor divvys up the physical resources of a machine (RAM, harddrive space, etc. ) for use by virtual machines. 

### Option B: See Attached

## Python
### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
Pseudocode often uses the structure of programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. It’s more user-friendly, and usually easier for people to pick up and begin programming. 

### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
- Interpreted language converts the typed code to machine code line by line. Interpreted language also often uses simpler and more human-friendly syntax for coding.
- Compiled language converts typed code to machine code at once.  If there is an issue somewhere in the code, the program will not run.

## Career Exploration
### College Central
I had not heard of this resource before. If I am looking for a job, I generally check Indeed, or LinkedIn, or another site like that, and send a bunch of resume’s out. This is a good resource to look at, especially if you need an internship to gain experience.

### Bureau of Labor Statistics
Looking under Computer and Information Technology jobs, it looks like most of the jobs require bachelor's degrees for entry level positions. Though, Web Development apparently only requires an associates degree and the median salary is $75k a year. 

### Certifications
- CompTIA - CompTIA has many different certifications for various areas of technology expertise. These are fairly standard to see on anyone’s resume who is applying for a tech job.
- Cisco certifications - These are also certifications that look good on a resume. It looks like they have more courses on data center type work.
- CISSP - This is one I have seen on resumes but didn't actually know what it meant. CISSP stands for Certified Information Systems Security Professional. This one also meets the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 8570.1, so if you’re looking for a DoD job, this would be great on a resume.

### Certificates and Degrees
Tri-C has a number of degrees and certificates. The Data Analytics certificate looks interesting to me. I took a brief course on SQL, and I found databases very interesting. Especially with all the data that is being collected through various apps, cookies, and location information, it’s good to see how that is used. 

### Co-ops / Internships
A Cooperative Education (Co-op) gives students hands-on learning experience through job assignments related to their area of study.
An Internship is usually a partnership between students, colleges, and employers that give you college credits for on the job work experience. They are either paid or unpaid, though from personal experience, it is hard to find a good paid internship.

To become “Co-op ready” you must:
- Currently enrolled at Cuyahoga Community College
- Completed 12 credit hours of college coursework (includes transfer credits) with at least two courses related to your major field
- GPA of 2.75 or higher
- Complete the Application of Interest
- Participate in the co-op orientation process through the Career Center
- Upload your resume for final revisions and approval by a Career Coach at Handshake
- Complete and sign a "Cooperative Education Agreement" form


### Industry Associations / Student Organizations
ACM-W looks very cool. ACM stands for Association for Computing Machinery and the W, I am assuming, stands for Women. This looks like an organization that supports women studying computer science, and further into their careers. I am going to look more into this organization. 

## Conclusion
In this unit we learned about the different types of software. We explored virtualization, which is very interesting, and I am going to examine this further. I have a friend who set up an entertainment server for his house with several terabytes of movies, music, etc. I think something similar would be a great first experiment for me to get into virtualization. We worked in Python, which I admit I like more than C++, it is more intuitive.  I am also interested in looking into a few of the clubs that I did not previously know existed, especially the ACM-W.

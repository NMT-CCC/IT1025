## Executive Summary
In lab #1, we explore the concepts of information systems, along with the history of client-server businesses.

## Information System Components
Information systems are defined as networks of hardware, software and telecommunications networks which collect, process, store, and distribute information in a useful organizational way.

To be considered an informational system, five major components are needed:

- Hardware - The physical machines, keyboards, harddrives, monitors, etc.
- Software - There are two types of software, Operating systems and Application software. Operating systems are the software interface between the hardware, the user, and the application software. Application software allows the user to perform tasks, such as creating a document or messaging a friend across the country.
- Data - Data is information that can be analyzed or used in an effort to gain knowledge or make decisions. To be useful it needs to be aggregated, indexed, and organized into a database.
- People - The humans who interact with the information systems.
- Processes - A process is a set of steps to reach a desired and predictable end-state.

## GitHub and Client - Server Architecture
Client-server architecture allows the user to use their computer as a terminal to access information on a different server. Accessing websites on the internet is an example of this architecture, as you're getting information on an offsite server and returning that information to your PC. GitHub is an example of "Client-Server'' architecture.  

## Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Most cloud computing services are on demand, so vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes. You can also have cloud servers all around the world to make accessing that information fast and easy for a large number of clients.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, I learned a bit more about cloud computing. I had to work the operational end of this in previous jobs, purchasing server space in offsite server farms, checking with IT on how much storage they needed, if remote servers were needed for an international office, etc. It was nice to read a succinct breakdown of exactly what was going on here. I look forward to learning more about client-server architecture.

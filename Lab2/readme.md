## Executive Summary 
For this unit, we explore the inner workings of different components in a computer.

## Hardware
Hardware is any computer component that you can physically touch. Keyboards, monitors, motherboards, and harddrives are all considered hardware. 

### Hard Drives and Memory

There are two main types of hard drives. A Hard Disk, in which information is stored on a spinning platter, and Solid State Drives, also known as SSD’s, which use a form of flash memory that is suitable for long term storage. 
RAM, or Random Access Memory, is basically a preloading area for information that your computer will need to process. RAM is also considered ‘volatile’, in that if there is an interruption in power to the machine, all RAM data will be lost. Hard Drives are non-volatile storage, in that if the power suddenly fails, your information is still in the harddrive. 


#### Latency and Transfer Rates

Hard Drive latency refers to the physical time it takes for the disk to rotate to the correct position to access a given piece of data.
Hard drive transfer rates refer to how quickly data can be transferred to and from the actual disk platter.  

#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
Traditional hard drives are slower to access information and have various moving parts rendering them susceptible to mechanical failure.  A SSD uses no moving parts and the information is accessed almost instantly, similar to RAM, by using a drive-wide address system. 

#### Random Access Memory
Adding RAM to your computer will allow the required information to load from the harddrive to the CPU faster. When you use a program, the information for that program is loaded into RAM, if you do not have adequate RAM in your computer, it will have to return over and over to the harddrive to retrieve the relevant information, thus slowing the computer. 

64 and 32 bit refers to the number of bits of data that are transferred in one clock cycle. 


### ALU and the Control Unit
The ALU stands for the Arithmetic Logic Unit. The ALU performs all of the mathematical processes that need to be handled by the CPU. The Control Unit in a CPU directs where information needs to go. The control unit receives instruction from the RAM, and tells the ALU what kind of  operation to perform.

### CPU, Input & Output
All computers do the same 4 basic things. Input information, store information, process information, and output information.
CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, acts as the brain of the computer. In terms of pumping gas at a gas station, we can think of it as the gas being the information. Pumping the gas (input) into the tank (storage), gas goes from the tank to the engine (storage to processing) and ignites a spark in the combustion chamber and then the car drives (processing to output).

### Logic Gates 
A logic gate is a circuit with 2 outputs and one input. There are different types of logic gates, including AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, and NOR. A truth table can help one understand all of the possible outcomes from a type of logic gate.
In an AND logic gate, for example, both inputs must be the same (1) to progress through the gate. 
In an OR logic gate, if either one of the inputs is 1, the output will also be 1.  



### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
IEEE’s is an organization encouraging technological innovation for the benefit of humanity.
IEEE’s code of ethics is fairly simple:
To uphold the highest standards of integrity, responsible behavior, and ethical conduct in professional activities.
To treat all persons fairly and with respect, to not engage in harassment or discrimination, and to avoid injuring others.
To strive to ensure this code is upheld by colleagues and co-workers.
I agree with every point on here and believe that all businesses should follow a similar line. When applied specifically to technology though, there are some mad-scientist projects that would be unacceptable to this organization. Combat drones, espionage tech, rigged election software being a few that come to mind.

## Data Representation

### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
Binary is a number system using a base  of 2, Decimals are set on a base 10, and Hexadecimals are on a base of 16. Binary has 8 places




### Hexadecimal Color Representation
Hex numbers use 16 digits:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F

00 is the absence of color in the hex-color chart. FF is a super-saturated color. 
The colors are separated into 3 colors in the RBG chart, 2 color values for each, once you put all three color values together, you get the 6 digit hex code for that color.
For the color #ab00ff you have 67.1% red, 0% green and 100% blue.
This gives you a very vibrant fuschia. This would be a terrible color for website design as it is very bright and hard on the eyes. A more muted color would be better to be able to read the text on a site.

## Conclusion
Lab 2 has been very informative. I had only a very basic understanding of binary, and no real understanding of hexadecimal, now I can convert numbers back and forth! I had absolutely no idea about logic gates, I just knew that computers spoke in 1’s and 0’s, not necessarily what you could do with those little bits. Same with hard drives, I knew SSD’s were faster, but not specifically why. I even taught my 8 year old daughter (who loves math!) how to convert decimal numbers to binary. Helping to teach someone a new concept really cements it in our own minds, sometimes.

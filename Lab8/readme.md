## Executive Summary 
Explore relational data and how it applies to SQL. 
Look at the four V’s of big data.
Discuss ethical and legal implications of information systems.  

## Data, Information and Knowledge
### Compare and contrast data, information and knowledge
Data is simply raw information.  It usually comes in either quantitative (numerical) or qualitative (descriptive) forms. 
Information is data that provides the user with context, relevance, and purpose.  
Knowledge is knowing how to apply that data and information in the real world. 

### Relational Data
If you were creating a database for a small company and two tables you identify are: customers and orders, explain the following under the Relational Data heading (be sure to use the example in the chapter as a guide - customers and orders would be like clubs and events)
#### Primary Key:
The primary key would be Customer ID in the customers table, and the Order number in the Orders table.
#### Relationship between customers and orders:
You would be able to see all orders from a particular customer, or alternately, every customer who ordered a particular product.
#### Foreign key of orders table:
 A foreign key is a field in one table that connects to the primary key data in the original table. So in this case, the Customer ID would be a foreign key in the Order Number table, and the Order number would be a foreign key in the Customer ID table.
### Field Data Types:
The orders table would likely have a date ordered field, the customer ID, the order number, the item codes, payment method, date shipped out, and an inventory correction.
The customer ID table would have the customer ID, their phone number, shipping address, previous purchases, dates of those purchases, and a notes field. 

### Big Data
#### Four "V's of Big Data
Volume  - the volume of data refers to the size of the data that needs to be processed, data sets in Big Data are too large to process with a regular laptop or desktop processor. An example of a high-volume data set would be all credit card transactions on a day within Europe.
Velocity - velocity refers to the speed with which data is generated. High velocity data is generated with such a pace that it requires distinct processing techniques. An example of a data that is generated with high velocity would be Twitter messages or Facebook posts.
Variety  - variety makes Big Data really big. Big Data comes from a great variety of sources and generally is one out of three types: structured, semi structured and unstructured data. The variety in data types frequently requires distinct processing capabilities and specialist algorithms. Such as a security system for a large building with CC cameras, audio, and alarms.
Veracity - veracity refers to the quality of the data that is being analyzed. High veracity data has a lot of important, low veracity data, on the other hand, has a lot of meaningless data. The non-valuable in these data sets is referred to as noise. 


#### Technology Driving the need for Big Data

## Structured Query Language (SQL) 
### RDBMS and SQL
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System, and it is the basis for SQL. Most modern database management systems are based on RDBMS, such as SOL, MS SOL Server, Oracle, MySQL, IBM DB2, and Microsoft Access.
### Relationship, Primary and Foreign Keys
I will talk about the Order details and the Products fields. Both Order ID and Product ID are primary keys in the Order Details field, and the Product ID is the primary key in the Products field. 
## SQL Injections
SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques, it is the placement of malicious code into an SQL statement. SQL parameters can protect you from SQL injection. This means that the SQL engine checks each parameter to make sure it’s correct for its column and not as part of the SQL to be executed.

## Ethical and Legal Implications
### Code of Ethics
A code of ethics clarifies and encourages the acceptable standards of behavior for a professional group. While it has no legal binding, if you violate the terms, you can be expelled from the group.
### Intellectual Property
Intellectual Property rights are legal rights for things that people create or invent. Intellectual property rights include patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret rights. If someone got a hold of the SVG file that I made, and proceeded to use it for their business, I would have little recourse other than a tenuous legal battle. If I had the image copyrighted, it would be a much faster process to hold them accountable for using my design without permission.
### Information Collection
COPPA imposes requirements on operators of websites or online services directed at or regarding collecting personal information from children under 13 years of age.
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a federal law that requires the creation of national standards to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient’s consent or knowledge. 


## Conclusion
So far SQL is my favorite programming language that I’ve encountered in this class, and I will definitely have to play with it more. It seems very straightforward and I like the organizational aspect of it.
